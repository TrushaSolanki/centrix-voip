# DesignPrototype 

## Overview

This branch, `DesignPrototype`, serves as the main showcase for design and functionality advancements for our web application. It's primarily used to share progress and prototypes with both frontend and backend development teams, ensuring alignment with the envisioned app features and design.

## Purpose

- **Visual and Functional Design:** This branch contains the latest iterations of the app's design, serving as a visual and functional reference for how the app should ultimately appear and operate. It's crucial for both development teams to align their work with these specifications for a cohesive user experience.

- **Reference Code:** Note that this branch is intended for reference purposes only. The code here should not be directly integrated into the main codebase without proper review and refactoring. The frontend development team is expected to optimize, refine, and organize the components and code structure for production readiness, ensuring best practices and maintainability.
